#### Key Functions:

##### `getPlayerName()`

```javascript
function getPlayerName() {
  let name = prompt("Enter your name:", "Player");
  if (!name) name = "Player";
  playerName = name;
  playerNameDisplay.textContent = playerName;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Prompts the user to enter their name when the game loads
- **Operation**: Sets a default "Player" if no name is entered
- **Importance**: Personalizes the game experience

##### `handleBoxClick(event)`

```javascript
function handleBoxClick(event) {
  const clickedBox = event.target;
  const boxIndex = Array.from(boxes).indexOf(clickedBox);

  if (gameState[boxIndex] !== "" || !gameActive) {
    return;
  }

  updateGameState(boxIndex);
  checkResult();
  if (gameActive) {
    currentPlayer = currentPlayer === "X" ? "O" : "X";
    if (currentPlayer === "O") {
      aiMove();
    }
  }
}
```

- **Purpose**: Handles player clicks on the game board
- **Operation**:
  1. Identifies which box was clicked
  2. Checks if the move is valid
  3. Updates the game state
  4. Checks if the game is won/tied
  5. Switches player and triggers AI move if needed
- **Importance**: This is the primary way players interact with the game

##### `updateGameState(index)`

```javascript
function updateGameState(index) {
  gameState[index] = currentPlayer;
  boxes[index].textContent = currentPlayer;

  // Add player-specific class for styling
  if (currentPlayer === "X") {
    boxes[index].classList.add("player-x");
  } else {
    boxes[index].classList.add("player-o");
  }
}
```

- **Purpose**: Updates the game state after a move
- **Operation**:
  1. Records the move in the game state array
  2. Updates the visual display of the board
  3. Adds appropriate styling based on the player (X or O)
- **Importance**: Maintains consistency between game logic and visual representation

##### `checkResult()`

```javascript
function checkResult() {
  let roundWon = false;
  for (let i = 0; i < winningConditions.length; i++) {
    const [a, b, c] = winningConditions[i];
    if (gameState[a] === "" || gameState[b] === "" || gameState[c] === "") {
      continue;
    }
    if (gameState[a] === gameState[b] && gameState[a] === gameState[c]) {
      roundWon = true;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (roundWon) {
    // Victory handling logic
    // Updates score and displays winner message
    gameActive = false;
    msgContainer.classList.remove("hide");
    return;
  }

  if (!gameState.includes("")) {
    msg.textContent = "It's a draw!";
    gameActive = false;
    msgContainer.classList.remove("hide");
  }
}
```

- **Purpose**: Checks if the current state of the board results in a win or draw
- **Operation**:
  1. Checks all possible winning conditions
  2. If a win is found, updates scores and displays winner message
  3. If all cells are filled without a winner, declares a draw
- **Importance**: Critical for game flow and determining outcomes

##### `aiMove()`

```javascript
function aiMove() {
  // Convert 1D gameState array to 2D board for minimax algorithm
  const board2D = [
    [gameState[0], gameState[1], gameState[2]],
    [gameState[3], gameState[4], gameState[5]],
    [gameState[6], gameState[7], gameState[8]],
  ];

  // Call the minimax AI function from ai.js to determine the best move
  const move = bestMove(board2D);

  if (move) {
    // Convert 2D coordinates back to 1D index
    const index = move.i * 3 + move.j;
    updateGameState(index);
    checkResult();
    if (gameActive) {
      currentPlayer = "X";
    }
  }
}
```

- **Purpose**: Handles the computer's move in the game
- **Operation**:
  1. Transforms the game state to a format usable by the AI

  3. Applies the move and checks results
  4. Returns control to the player
- **Importance**: Enables single-player gameplay against the computer

##### `resetGame()`

```javascript
function resetGame() {
  gameActive = true;
  currentPlayer = "X";
  gameState = ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""];
  boxes.forEach((box) => {
    box.textContent = "";
    box.classList.remove("player-x", "player-o");
  });
  msgContainer.classList.add("hide");

  // Always ensure player name is displayed correctly
  playerNameDisplay.textContent = playerName;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Resets the game to its initial state
- **Operation**:
  1. Resets game flags and state arrays
  2. Clears the visual board
  3. Hides any win/draw messages

      roundWon = true;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (roundWon) {
    statusDisplay.textContent = `Player ${currentPlayer} has won!`;
    gameActive = false;
    return;
  }

  if (!board.includes("")) {
    statusDisplay.textContent = "Game ended in a draw!";
    gameActive = false;
    return;
  }

  currentPlayer = currentPlayer === "X" ? "O" : "X";
}
```

- **Purpose**: Checks for win or draw conditions
- **Operation**: Evaluates the board state against winning patterns
- **Importance**: Determines when a game ends and why

### ai.js - AI Implementation

This file contains the AI's decision-making logic using the minimax algorithm, which ensures the AI makes optimal moves.

#### Understanding the Minimax Algorithm

The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player games like Tic Tac Toe, Chess, and Go. Here's how it works in this implementation:

1. **Basic Principle**: The AI considers all possible future states of the game and chooses the move that leads to the best outcome, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.

2. **Recursive Evaluation**:

   - The algorithm recursively simulates all possible moves from the current state
   - For each possible move, it alternates between maximizing (AI's turn) and minimizing (player's turn)
   - It continues until reaching terminal states (win, loss, draw)

3. **Scoring System**:

   - AI win: +1 point
   - Human win: -1 point
   - Draw: 0 points

4. **Decision Making**:

   - When it's the AI's turn (maximizing player), it picks the move with the highest score
   - When it's the human's turn (minimizing player), it assumes the human will pick the move with the lowest score

5. **Implementation in Our Game**:
   - The `bestMove()` function tries every available position
   - For each position, it uses `minimax()` to evaluate how good that move is
   - It selects the move with the highest score

This makes our AI unbeatable - the best a human player can achieve against it is a draw (when playing perfectly).

#### Key Functions:

##### `minimax(board, depth, isMaximizing)`

```javascript
function minimax(board, depth, isMaximizing) {
  const scores = {
    X: -1,
    O: 1,
    tie: 0,
  };

  let result = checkWinner(board);
  if (result !== null) {
    return scores[result];
  }

  if (isMaximizing) {
    let bestScore = -Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {
        if (board[i][j] === "") {
          board[i][j] = "O"; // AI is O
          let score = minimax(board, depth + 1, false);
          board[i][j] = ""; // Undo move
          bestScore = Math.max(score, bestScore);
        }
      }
    }
    return bestScore;
  } else {
    let bestScore = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {
        if (board[i][j] === "") {
          board[i][j] = "X"; // Player is X
          let score = minimax(board, depth + 1, true);
          board[i][j] = ""; // Undo move
          bestScore = Math.min(score, bestScore);
        }
      }
    }
    return bestScore;
  }
}
```

- **Purpose**: Implements the minimax algorithm for AI decision making
- **Operation**:
  1. Recursively evaluates all possible future game states
  2. Assigns scores to end states (win/loss/draw)
  3. Works backward to determine the optimal move
  4. Uses maximizing/minimizing logic to simulate both players' best moves
- **Importance**: Makes the AI "intelligent" and challenging to beat

##### `checkWinner(board)`

```javascript
function checkWinner(board) {
  const winningCombinations = [
    [
      [0, 0],
      [0, 1],
      [0, 2],
    ],
    [
      [1, 0],
      [1, 1],
      [1, 2],
    ],
    [
      [2, 0],
      [2, 1],
      [2, 2],
    ],
    [
      [0, 0],
      [1, 0],
      [2, 0],
    ],
    [
      [0, 1],
      [1, 1],
      [2, 1],
    ],
    [
      [0, 2],
      [1, 2],
      [2, 2],
    ],
    [
      [0, 0],
      [1, 1],
      [2, 2],
    ],
    [
      [0, 2],
      [1, 1],
      [2, 0],
    ],
  ];

  for (let combination of winningCombinations) {
    const [a, b, c] = combination;
    if (
      board[a[0]][a[1]] &&
      board[a[0]][a[1]] === board[b[0]][b[1]] &&
      board[a[0]][a[1]] === board[c[0]][c[1]]
    ) {
      return board[a[0]][a[1]];
    }
  }

  if (board.flat().every((cell) => cell !== "")) {
    return "tie";
  }

  return null;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Checks if the game has been won or tied
- **Operation**:
  1. Evaluates all possible winning combinations on the 2D board
  2. Returns the winner symbol or 'tie' if applicable
  3. Returns null if the game is ongoing
- **Importance**: Essential for the minimax algorithm to evaluate game states

##### `bestMove(board)`

```javascript
function bestMove(board) {
  let bestScore = -Infinity;
  let move;

  for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {
      if (board[i][j] === "") {
        board[i][j] = "O"; // AI is O
        let score = minimax(board, 0, false);
        board[i][j] = ""; // Undo move
        if (score > bestScore) {
          bestScore = score;
          move = { i, j };
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return move;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Determines the best possible move for the AI
- **Operation**:
  1. Tries each available position on the board
  2. Uses minimax to evaluate the future consequences of each move
  3. Selects the move with the highest score (most likely to lead to win)
- **Importance**: This is the entry point for the AI's decision making, ensuring it plays optimally

## How to Play

1. When you open the game, you'll be prompted to enter your name
2. You play as "X" and the computer plays as "O"

### Key Data Structures

1. **Game State Array**: A 1D array of 9 elements representing the board:

   ```
   [0, 1, 2]
   [3, 4, 5]
   [6, 7, 8]
   ```

2. **Winning Combinations**: Array of arrays representing all possible winning patterns:
   ```javascript
   [
     [0, 1, 2], // Top row
     [3, 4, 5], // Middle row
     [6, 7, 8], // Bottom row
     [0, 3, 6], // Left column
     [1, 4, 7], // Middle column
     [2, 5, 8], // Right column
     [0, 4, 8], // Diagonal top-left to bottom-right
     [2, 4, 6], // Diagonal top-right to bottom-left
   ];
   ```

## Deep Dive into the Minimax Algorithm

To help beginners truly understand how the AI makes its decisions, let's walk through a simplified example of how the minimax algorithm evaluates moves:

### Example: Making a Decision

Let's say we have this board state (X = human player, O = AI):

```
  O | X | O
 ---+---+---
    | X |
 ---+---+---
    |   |
```

The AI is determining its next move by evaluating all empty squares:

1. **For the middle-left position:**

   ```
   O | X | O
   ---+---+---
   O | X |
   ---+---+---
     |   |
   ```

   - The AI simulates placing 'O' here
   - Then simulates the human placing 'X' in all remaining spots
   - Through recursion, it determines this might lead to a draw
   - Score: 0

2. **For the bottom-middle position:**

   ```
   O | X | O
   ---+---+---
     | X |
   ---+---+---
     | O |
   ```

   - The AI simulates placing 'O' here
   - Through recursion, it determines the human can still force a draw
   - Score: 0

3. **For the bottom-left position:**

   ```
   O | X | O
   ---+---+---
     | X |
   ---+---+---
   O |   |
   ```

   - The AI simulates placing 'O' here
   - This creates a winning diagonal from top-left to bottom-right!
   - Score: +1

4. **For the bottom-right position:**
   ```
   O | X | O
   ---+---+---
     | X |
   ---+---+---
     |   | O
   ```
   - The AI simulates placing 'O' here
   - Through recursion, it determines this might lead to a draw
   - Score: 0

Since the bottom-left position has the highest score (+1), the AI will choose that move, resulting in a win.

### Recursion in Minimax

The recursive nature of minimax is what makes it powerful. For each possible move:

1. The function calls itself to evaluate the opponent's best response
2. Then it evaluates its own best response to that
3. This continues until reaching a terminal state (win/loss/draw)
4. The scores bubble back up to determine the best initial move

### Time Complexity

In Tic Tac Toe, the minimax algorithm creates a game tree with a maximum depth of 9 (the number of squares on the board). This is manageable for a computer but would be extremely complex for larger games like Chess.

## Extending the Game

Want to add features to the game? Here are some ideas:

- Add difficulty levels by limiting the minimax depth (making the AI easier to beat)
- Implement a two-player mode for playing against a friend
- Add sound effects for moves and wins
- Create a game history tracker to review past games
- Add animations for win conditions (highlight the winning line)
- Implement a timer for each move
- Add an option to let the AI go first
- Create a statistics dashboard showing win/loss percentages

---

This Tic Tac Toe game demonstrates important programming concepts like:

- Event handling
- Game state management
- Recursive algorithms (minimax)
- DOM manipulation
- CSS animations and styling

Have fun playing and exploring the code!
