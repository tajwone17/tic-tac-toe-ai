# Tic Tac Toe AI

This project is a modern implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game featuring an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. Challenge yourself against an unbeatable AI that calculates the optimal move for every game state.

## Features

- **Sleek, Responsive UI**: Modern design with smooth animations and responsive layout
- **Intelligent AI**: Powered by the Minimax algorithm for optimal play
- **Visual Feedback**: Distinctive colors for X and O players with hover effects
- **Game State Management**: Tracks wins, draws, and active player status
- **Reset Options**: Easily restart games with dedicated buttons

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structured markup for the game board and UI elements
- **CSS3**: Stylish design with transitions, gradients, and responsive layouts
- **JavaScript**: Core game logic, AI implementation, and DOM manipulation

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. You play as "X" and always go first
3. Click on any empty square to make your move
4. The AI (player "O") will automatically respond with its move
5. The game ends when either player gets three in a row or the board fills up
6. Use the "Reset Game" button to start a new match

## AI Implementation

The game features an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm implemented in `js/ai.js`. This algorithm:

- Explores all possible future game states
- Evaluates each potential outcome
- Chooses the move that maximizes the AI's chances of winning
- Is effectively unbeatable - the best you can achieve is a draw!

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main game interface
- `css/style.css`: Styling and animations
- `js/app.js`: Core application logic and game initialization
- `js/game.js`: Game state management and win detection
- `js/ai.js`: AI implementation with Minimax algorithm

## Future Improvements

- Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Implement a scoring system
- Add sound effects
- Create a multiplayer mode
- Add animations for winning combinations
